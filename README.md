<h1 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">🛒 E-Commerce - Junior Baby</h1>

Junior Baby E-commerce is an online store developed to help a physical retail shop expand its reach and improve inventory management. The platform allows customers to browse and purchase a variety of baby products, while providing administrators with tools to manage stock, track orders, and handle promotions efficiently. Designed with a responsive layout, the system ensures a smooth shopping experience across all devices. All that made during my intership.
